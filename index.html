    <ins><h2>My Journey as a Student</h2></ins>
    <p> 
      Life of a grade school student is different from the life of a college student.
      As a first year college student, it was so hard to adjust and catch up with what was going on.
      Life humbled me, to the point I looked down upon myself.
      I thought maybe college was not for me, but instead of giving up I chose to continue and pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can define myself as a dedicated person, someone who is willing and eager to acquire new knowledge.
      I am compassionate in achieving my goals in life and motivated to reach my aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, I still don’t fully know who I am, but I do know I am a student with purpose, worth, and value.
      I chose Information Technology because I have loved computers since I was 9 years old.
      That’s why I took this course. I told myself, <“What if I try?> There’s no wrong in trying.
      If somebody can do this, I can do this too.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to enhance my analytical skills, learn coding and programming, and grow through every struggle.
      Despite the hardest battles, I strive to remain genuine and wise. 
      I believe that many opportunities are waiting, whatever path I choose.
